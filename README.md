## Summary - Building AI course project
Dota 2 - personal coach. A project that tries to help dota2 players and coached to predict the outcome based on the hero and item selections

**Your idea in a nutshell**: Dota2 - Personal coach

**Background**: My problem is not really a problem, just something that could be solved / helped with the help of machine learning. In the game of Dota 2, there are hundred + heroes that have different permutations. On top of that each hero can equip different items. In one game of dota correct heroes and items can decide the outcome of game. Using machine learning we could identify what heroes to pick and counter pick and what items would be optimal in what situations. The topic in itself is not important but Dota2 has hundreds of millions of players and has tournaments of million of dollars. I bet this could be useful.

**Data and AI techniques**: The data that can be fetched using Valve's own API. The data comes directly in the JSON format

**How is it used**: My solution could be used by individual players or esports organizations 

**Challenges**: It's hard to pinpoint the challenges without actually starting to do it. I am suspecting that the due to huge amount of data and huge amount of parameters that could be derived from the data the line has to be drawn somewhere. For example: for starts a a simple linear regression could shown a positive or negative correlation between certain heroes? 

**What next**: Again, the amount of data is huge. The amount of parameters and what goes in the game
