# Dota2 Personal Coach - Building AI course project

A program that helps players of dota 2 predict the outcome based on heroe and item selections

## Summary

My problem is not really a problem, just something that could be solved / helped with the help of machine learning. In the game of Dota 2, there are hundred + heroes that have different permutations. On top of that each hero can equip different items. In one game of dota correct heroes and items can decide the outcome of game. Using machine learning we could identify what heroes to pick and counter pick and what items would be optimal in what situations. The topic in itself is not important but Dota2 has hundreds of millions of players and has tournaments of million of dollars. I bet this could be useful.
