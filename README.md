# Dota2 Personal Coach - Building AI course project

## Summary

In the game of Dota 2, correct hero and item selection can win the game. A tool that could predict the outcome based on said selection and advise could be a very powerful ally.

**Data and AI techniques**: The data that can be fetched using Valve's own API. The data comes directly in the JSON format

**How is it used**: My solution could be used by individual players or esports organizations 

**Challenges**: It's hard to pinpoint the challenges without actually starting to do it. I am suspecting that due to huge amount of data and huge amount of parameters that could be derived from the data the line has to be drawn somewhere. For example: for starters a a simple linear regression could show a positive or negative correlation between certain heroes

**What next**: From there we could build up the tool to include the on the fly seleciton of the heroes in the draft phase.
